        <H1>Introduction</H1>
        <H2>Instruction</H2>
        <P>
          Clarke & Watt Building Consultancy Limited were instructed by{" "}
          {clientName} to carry out a Building Survey and to prepare a report
          advising on the general state of repair and condition of {address}
        </P>
        <P>
          We understand that the purpose of the inspection is in connection with
          the proposed sale of {address}, to satisfy concerns raised by the
          prospective buyer's lender in relation to their 'nil' valuation of the
          property
        </P>
        <H2>Limitations</H2>
        <P>
          Our Report concentrates on the general standard and condition of the
          building and any principal defects or shortcomings and is not intended
          to be a report listing all items of repair, redecoration or
          reinstatement works.
        </P>
        <P>
          This report is based on a visual inspection of the readily accessible
          areas of the property only and in accordance with the limitations
          contained in our Scope of Service provided previously. No steps were
          taken to expose elements of the structure otherwise concealed or to
          remove surface finishes for the examination of underlying elements. As
          such, we are unable to confirm that inaccessible and concealed parts
          of the property are free from defects.
        </P>
        <P>
          We were not instructed to make arrangements for specialist surveys of
          the drainage installations, the water distribution systems, the
          mechanical systems or the electrical systems or for these to be tested
          by a specialist. We have, however, made recommendations where we
          believe that tests should be carried out and made a brief comment
          where something has been found from a visual inspection to be
          obviously defective.
        </P>
        <P>
          We have not been instructed to organise a structural assessment to
          determine floor loadings.
        </P>
        <P>
          We have not been instructed to establish the capacity of the
          electrical incoming supply nor to ascertain whether any other live
          services are connected to the premises.
        </P>
        <P>
          We have not carried out any geological survey or site investigation
          and cannot confirm the nature or characteristics of the soil with
          regards to fill or possible contamination. Normal legal searches
          should confirm the past use of the site and if instructed, we will
          advise further.
        </P>
        <P>
          Our examination of the roof covering and roof features such as
          chimneys, skylights, etc. were confined to an inspection from ground
          level.
        </P>
        <P>
          Subject to the client's requirements, they may not wish to proceed
          with all works, but do so that their own risk. The list of works is by
          no means exhaustive. The works listed are considered necessary to
          prevent further deterioration of the property. Further investigations
          may reveal additional works and thus greater expenditure. The costs
          are subject to a competitively sought tender process and are intended
          for budgeting purposes only. All costs provided are exclusive of VAT,
          professional fees and access unless expressly stated.
        </P>
        <P>
          No internal access was provided to the garage, and we can therefore
          only provide comment on the visible external elements of the garage.
        </P>
        <P>
          This Report has been prepared for the sole use of {clientName}. NOTE.
          Permission is hereby granted for the contents of this survey to be
          circulated to all relevant parties involved in the sale / acquisition
          of the property.
        </P>

          <p>Important Note:</p>
          <p className="m-0">We carry out a desk-top study and make oral enquiries for information about matters affecting the property.</p>
          <p className="m-0">We carefully and thoroughly inspect the property using our best endeavours to see as much of it as is physically accessible. Where this is not possible an 
  explanation will be provided.</p>
          <p className="m-0">We visually inspect roofs, chimneys and other surfaces on the outside of the building from ground level and, if necessary, from neighbouring public property 
  and with the help of binoculars.</p>
          <p className="m-0">Flat roofs no more than 3m above ground level are inspected using a ladder where it is safe to do so.</p>
          <p className="m-0">We inspect the roof structure from inside the roof space if there is safe access. We examine floor surfaces and under-floor spaces so far as there is safe access 
  and permission from the owner.</p>
          <p className="m-0">We are not able to assess the condition of the inside of any chimney, boiler or other flues.</p>
          <p className="m-0">We do not lift fitted carpets or coverings without the owner's consent. Intermittent faults of services may not be apparent on the day of inspection. If we are 
  concerned about parts of the property that the inspection cannot cover, the report will tell you about any further investigations that are needed.</p>
          <p className="m-0">Where practicable and agreed we report on the cost of any work for identified repairs and make recommendations on how these repairs should be carried out. </p>
          <p className="m-0">Some maintenance and repairs we suggest may be expensive. Purely cosmetic and minor maintenance defects that do not affect performance might not be 
  reported. The report that we provide is not a warranty.</p>

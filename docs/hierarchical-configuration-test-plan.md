## 4. End-to-End Test Scenarios

### 4.1 Complete CRUD Workflows

#### **Section Management E2E**
```gherkin
Scenario: Create, edit, and delete a section
Given I am on the configuration page
When I click "Create New" and select "New Section"
And I fill in the section details and save
Then I should return to the configuration page
And the new section should be visible in the hierarchy
When I click on the section to edit it
And I modify the section name and save
Then I should return to the configuration page
And the section should show the updated name
When I right-click the section and select "Delete"
And I confirm the deletion
Then the section should be removed from the hierarchy
```

#### **Hierarchical Creation E2E**
```gherkin
Scenario: Create child entities through context menu
Given I have a section in the configuration tree
When I right-click the section and select "Add Element"
And I create the element and return
Then the element should appear under the section
When I right-click the element and select "Add Component"
And I create the component and return
Then the component should appear under the element
When I right-click the component and select "Add Condition"
And I create the condition and return
Then the condition should appear under the component
```

### 4.2 Search and Filter Workflows

#### **Search Across Entity Types E2E**
```gherkin
Scenario: Search for entities across different types
Given I have sections, elements, components, and conditions
When I search for a term that appears in multiple entity types
Then I should see results from all matching entity types
When I filter by "Components" only
Then I should see only matching components
When I clear the search
Then I should see the full hierarchy again
```

### 4.3 State Persistence Workflows

#### **Navigation State Persistence E2E**
```gherkin
Scenario: State persists across edit operations
Given I have expanded several nodes in the tree
And I have searched for a specific term
When I click on an entity to edit it
And I use the browser back button to return
Then the tree should be in the exact same state as before
And the edited entity should be highlighted
```

### 4.4 Mobile Responsiveness E2E

#### **Mobile Interaction E2E**
```gherkin
Scenario: Full functionality works on mobile devices
Given I am using a mobile device
When I access the configuration page
Then all touch targets should be appropriately sized
When I expand nodes and search for entities
Then the interface should remain usable
When I create and edit entities
Then the mobile forms should work correctly
```

### 4.5 Error Handling E2E

#### **Network Error Handling E2E**
```gherkin
Scenario: Graceful handling of network errors
Given I am offline
When I try to delete an entity
Then I should see an appropriate error message
When I go back online
Then the operation should retry automatically
```

## Test Data Setup

### Mock Data Requirements
- **Sections**: 5-10 sections with varying orders

- **Components**: 50-100 components with different material types
- **Conditions**: 100+ conditions associated with elements/components
- **Edge Cases**: Empty entities, missing relationships, malformed data

This comprehensive test plan ensures the hierarchical configuration feature is robust, accessible, and performs well across all supported platforms and use cases.

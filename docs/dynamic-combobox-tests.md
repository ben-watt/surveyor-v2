# DynamicComboBox Test Coverage

## Test Files Created

1. **DynamicComboBox.test.tsx** - Tests for the responsive wrapper component
2. **ComboBox.test.tsx** - Tests for the base ComboBox component

## Test Coverage

### DynamicComboBox Tests

#### Desktop Behavior
- ✓ Renders as a popover on desktop screens (≥768px)
- ✓ Shows selected value correctly on desktop
- ✓ Maintains standard ComboBox functionality

#### Mobile Behavior  
- ✓ Renders as a button that opens drawer on mobile (<768px)
- ✓ Opens drawer when button is clicked
- ✓ Displays selected value count for multi-select
- ✓ Displays selected label for single select

#### Responsive Behavior
- ✓ Switches between desktop and mobile modes when screen size changes
- ✓ No hooks errors when resizing window

#### Form Integration

- ✓ Handles object values with id comparison

### ComboBox Tests

#### Basic Functionality
- ✓ Renders with label
- ✓ Displays placeholder when no value selected
- ✓ Opens popover when clicked
- ✓ Filters options based on search input
- ✓ Handles hierarchical navigation with back button
- ✓ Handles multi-select mode with checkmarks
- ✓ Displays validation errors
- ✓ Calls onCreateNew callback when "Create new..." is clicked
- ✓ Handles object values with unique keys (no duplicate key warnings)

- ✓ Calls onClose callback when item is selected
- ✓ Has larger touch targets (py-3) for mobile usability

## Key Test Scenarios Covered

1. **Component Switching**: Tests verify the component switches correctly between desktop popover and mobile drawer based on screen size

2. **State Management**: Tests ensure selected values are properly displayed and managed in both single and multi-select modes

3. **User Interactions**: Click events, search filtering, and navigation are all tested

4. **Form Integration**: React Hook Form integration and validation are tested

5. **Edge Cases**: Object values, nested data structures, and responsive behavior edge cases are covered

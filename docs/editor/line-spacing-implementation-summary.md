# Line Spacing Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a line spacing feature for the BlockEditor, allowing users to adjust line height for paragraphs and headings using standard presets via a Google Docs-style dropdown menu.

## Implementation Date
October 23, 2025

## Components Created/Modified

### 1. LineHeight TipTap Extension
**File**: `app/home/components/TipTapExtensions/LineHeight.ts`

- Custom TipTap extension for managing line height attributes
- Supports paragraph and heading node types
- Default line height: 1.15
- Adds node attributes (not text marks) for paragraph-level control
- Commands:
  - `setLineHeight(height: string)`: Apply line height to selected nodes
  - `unsetLineHeight()`: Reset to default line height
- Proper HTML parsing and rendering with inline styles

### 2. BlockEditor Integration
**File**: `app/home/components/Input/BlockEditor.tsx`

- Imported and registered LineHeight extension
- Added to extensions array alongside other formatting extensions

### 3. MenuLineHeight UI Component
**File**: `app/home/components/Input/BlockMenuBar.tsx`

- Custom dropdown component following existing toolbar patterns
- Button with `AlignVerticalSpaceAround` icon from lucide-react
- Dropdown menu with 6 standard presets:
  - 1.0 (Single)
  - 1.15 (default)
  - 1.5
  - 2.0 (Double)
  - 2.5
  - 3.0
- Features:
  - Real-time tracking of current line height
  - Visual checkmark (✓) next to selected option
  - Click-outside-to-close functionality
  - Button highlights when dropdown is open
  - Proper vertical alignment with other toolbar buttons

## Technical Details

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Node Attributes vs Text Marks**
   - Line height is implemented as a node attribute (not a text mark)
   - Affects entire paragraphs/headings, not just selected text
   - More semantically correct for line spacing behavior

2. **Command Implementation**
   - Uses `tr.setNodeMarkup()` to update node attributes
   - Iterates through selected nodes using `tr.doc.nodesBetween()`
   - Maintains cursor position and selection state

3. **UI Pattern**
   - Follows the `HighlightColorPicker` pattern from existing codebase
   - Uses controlled state with `useState` and `useRef`
   - Event listeners for click-outside detection
   - Consistent with repo styling conventions

### CSS Output
Line height is rendered as inline styles:
```html
<p style="line-height: 1.5">Content here</p>
```

## Testing

     - Command availability
     - Standard presets application
     - getAttributes integration
     - Editor state management
     - HTML output
     - UI component needs
     - Edge cases
     - Command chaining

### Test Results
- **Total Tests**: 46
- **Passed**: 46 ✅
- **Failed**: 0
- **Coverage**: Comprehensive coverage of core functionality

## User Experience

### How to Use
1. Place cursor in any paragraph or heading
2. Click the line spacing button (3-line icon) in the toolbar
3. Select desired line spacing from dropdown
4. Line spacing applies immediately to the selected paragraph/heading
5. Different paragraphs can have different line spacings

### Visual Feedback
- Dropdown shows current line height with checkmark
- Button highlights when dropdown is open
- Clean, minimal toolbar footprint

## Code Quality

### Linting
- ✅ No linting errors
- ✅ Follows TypeScript strict mode
- ✅ Proper type definitions throughout

- ✅ Proper component naming (PascalCase)
- ✅ Event handlers named with `handle*` pattern
- ✅ Tests colocated in `tests/` directories
- ✅ JSDoc comments where appropriate

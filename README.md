### Sam Requests

  - two templates level 2 & level 3 
  - easy insert photos and save on devise 
  - drop down defects and add as many defects as possible per section if you want 
  - also note section and can amend the drop downs 
  - costings on the level 3 
  - color code defects 
  - Also we would like to add like a banner to the reports to make it look more professional 



### Next

Can we do something where we're less structured???. Rock up at a property take a load of pictures take a load of audio / video then interpret that data to understand what is useful in order to generate a survey. What would we need? An understanding of what is required for a survey 

- [AI: Review this image and identify any possible defects] (Easy)
- [AI: Link relevant bits of video, audio and text together] (Hard)
- [AI: Generate specific bits about each section] (Medium)
- [AI: Create a report with encapsulates all the information above] (Very hard)

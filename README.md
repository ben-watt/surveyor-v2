## Surveyor

- Generate Building Surveyor Reports Instantly

### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

```bash
aws sandbox
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Roadmap

### Now


  - Create CRUD for different entities with searchable lookups for each entity as a standard
    - Defects
    - Clients
    - Properties
    
  - Getting the export just right
    - Sorting out a defect vs. a condition


  - Getting the export just right
  - Address lookup

  - List out the form
  - Toasts (Deleted a form)

  - Don't use algolia for search?s

### Next

Can we do something where we're less structured???. Rock up at a property take a load of pictures take a load of audio / video then interpret that data to understand what is useful in order to generate a survey. What would we need? An understanding of what is required for a survey 

- [AI: Review this image and identify any possible defects] (Easy)
- [AI: Link relevant bits of video, audio and text together] (Hard)
- [AI: Generate specific bits about each section] (Medium)
- [AI: Create a report with encapsulates all the information above] (Very hard)
